# Oblique_impact

We include python notebooks used to create figures in a paper entitled <i> Subsurface pulse, crater and ejecta asymmetry from oblique impacts into granular media </i> 2023, Suo, B. et al. 

We include accelerometer data (in csv format) and crater profiles in a python data format. 
* `pulse_raw_data` contains all raw pulse data in .csv format. A data log is also included in this file
* `crater_ejecta_analysis` includes partial raw data (the other half can be found in [supplemental videos](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mMJmNE8pUu3A_qhFcitfoJNXRcd17B-7/view?usp=drive_link)). Scripts for analysing crater and ejecta properties are also included.
* the rest of the files include scripts for generating figures in the paper.
